# Covid_Data_Analysis
In this project, I have analyzed and explored covid data across the world with SQL using Microsoft SQL Server. Further I visualized the data using Tableau, creating insightful and visually appealing representations of the information. The COVID-19 data used in this analysis was sourced from Our World in Data, covering the period from 3rd January, 2020 to 17th May, 2023.
